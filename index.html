<strong style="font-size:20px;"><pre>Obama was born on August 4, 1961, at Kapiolani Medical Center for Women and Children in Honolulu, Hawaii.
He is the only president born outside the contiguous 48 states.
He was born to an American mother and a Kenyan father.
His mother, Ann Dunham (1942–1995), was born in Wichita, Kansas and was mostly of English descent, though in 2007.
it was discovered her great-great-grandfather Falmouth Kearney emigrated from the village of Moneygall, Ireland to the US in 1850.
In July 2012,Ancestry.com found a strong likelihood that Dunham was descended from John Punch,an enslaved African man who lived in the Colony of Virginia during the seventeenth century.
Obama's father, Barack Obama Sr. 
(1934–1982),[11][12] was a married[13][14][15] Luo Kenyan from Nyang'oma Kogelo.
Obama's parents met in 1960 in a Russian language class at the University of Hawaii at Manoa,
where his father was a foreign student on a scholarship.
The couple married in Wailuku, Hawaii, on February 2, 1961, six months before Obama was born.</pre></strong><br>
<h1 style="font-size:40px">Education</h1>
<strong style="font-size:20px;"><pre>At the age of six,<ins>Obama and his mother had moved to Indonesia to join his stepfather</ins>.
From age six to ten, he attended local Indonesian-language schools:<em>Sekolah Dasar Katolik Santo Fransiskus Asisi</em>(St. Francis of Assisi Catholic Elementary School)
for two years and Sekolah Dasar Negeri Menteng 01 <mark>(State Elementary School Menteng 01)</mark>for one and a half years, supplemented by English-language Calvert School homeschooling by his mother.
As a result of his four years in Jakarta, he was able to <b>speak Indonesian fluently</b>as a child.[31] During his time in Indonesia,

<ins>On February 10, 2007, Obama announced his candidacy for President of the United States in front of the Old State Capitol building in Springfield, Illinois</ins>.
The choice of the announcement site was viewed as <em>symbolic</em>, as it was also where <b>Abraham Lincoln</b> delivered his <strong>"House Divided"</strtong> speech in 1858.[165][167]
<mark>Obama emphasized issues of rapidly ending the Iraq War</mark>,increasing energy independence, and reforming the health care system.[168]
Numerous candidates entered the Democratic Party presidential primaries. The field narrowed to Obama and Senator Hillary Clinton after early contests,
with the race remaining close throughout the primary process, but with Obama gaining a steady lead in pledged delegates due to better long-range planning, 
superior fundraising, dominant organizing in caucus states, and better exploitation of delegate allocation<i> rules</i>.[169] On June 2,
2008, Obama had received enough votes to clinch his election.<cite> After an initial hesitation to concede</cite>, on June 7,Clinton ended her campaign and endorsed Obama.</pre><br>
